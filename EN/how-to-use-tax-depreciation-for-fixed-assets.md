# Tax depreciation of fixed assets

The tax depreciation functionality calculates and posts tax depreciation on fixed assets in accordance with the Income Tax Act (Act No. 586/1992 ยง26 - ยง33). It contains special settings for tax depreciation groups, where you can enter the depreciation period and method, depreciation rates and coefficients for new tax depreciation methods for fixed assets.

Each tangible fixed asset belongs to a depreciation group. These groups determine the minimum depreciation period and the parameters used to calculate depreciation.
The following methods of depreciating tangible fixed assets (FA) for tax purposes are available:

- Straight-Line - this method is based on Unit Cost and Percentage.
- Declining-Balance - this method is based on Book Value and a Coefficient (declining balance).
- Straight-line Intangible - this method is based on Unit Cost and Percentage.

Each fixed asset is assigned to a specific Depreciation group. These groups determine the minimum depreciation period and the parameters used to calculate depreciation.
