# Sales correcting documents

The functionality allows you to indicate the type of sales document in the header of the sales document and influence the print report accordingly.

According to the revision of the VAT Law, it is necessary to classify the types of sales credits. This function allows users to set the following types of credit memos:

- Tax corrective documents
- Internal correction
- Tax insolvency document
