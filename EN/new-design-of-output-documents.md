# New design of output documents

This is a list of external documents of the company that are printed towards customers or vendors, therefore their uniform appearance has been modified and all legislative requirements have been added.

A new set of print reports has been created for the company's external documents.
All documents have the same appearance (header, footer, font type and size, etc.).
  
In addition, the output documents were expanded to include all the prerequisites required by Czech legislation: 

- Reg. No., Tax Reg. No.
- Advance deduction with invoice information and date of payment received
- Print VAT specification grouped by VAT identifier
- Naming of corrective tax documents based on the type of Cr. memo
- Printing of documents related to advances
