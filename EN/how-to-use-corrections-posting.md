# Corrective posting (Red Storno)

According to the requirements of the legislation, costs and revenues are usually only charged to either the Debit or Credit G/L Account. Companies in Eastern Europe usually follow an accounting policy whereby certain inventory and financial transactions in the general ledger must be accounted for as adjustments. This is because auditors and financial authorities carry out accounting controls in accordance with this policy.  

The purpose of this functionality is:

- Enable the head accountant to enforce corrective posting in the required GL accounts.
- Allow the head accountant to enforce inventory corrective posting (negative transfer entries, expected cost posting).
- Enable the head accountant to enforce corrective posting of reversal adjustment in fixed assets.
- Enable users to make one-click corrective posting (financial, inventory and job postings).
