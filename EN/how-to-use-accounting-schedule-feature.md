# Accounting schemes - extensions

For one of the most used application areas for analysis and reporting, Eastern European countries require the following improvements to the functionality of standard accounting schemes:

- Common expression list - the common expression list contains named rows that can be used as formulas for all Account Schedules. This is achieved by defining one Account Schedule as a common list of expressions called Shared Account Schedule.
- Saving analysis results (current status) - this enhancement allows the user to save the results of an analysis performed using Account Schedules.
- Formula Analysis - this extension allows the user to analyze the results of formulas. Analysis is now available for Sum Type - Formula. Analyzing a formula result will show the user a new form containing a list of elements used for the calculation and their description.
- Additional data sources - in addition to being able to perform analysis based on G/L entries, users can now perform analysis based on VAT entries, customer entries, vendor entries and value entries.
