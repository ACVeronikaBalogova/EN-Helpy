# Unreliable payer institute  

The amendment to the VAT Act 235/2004 (ยง 106a) introduced the institute of unreliable taxpayer. The Ministry of Finance publishes electronically a list of unreliable taxpayers.  
This feature uses this service to retrieve disclosed information and show payer status on Vendor Cards and Purchase Documents.  
The Ministry of Finance also publishes information on registered payer bank accounts (only these accounts are allowed for payments). Information on registered payer bank accounts is stored in the Vendor Bank Accounts and used in the payment.
