# Additional VAT reporting  

According to ยง 43 part 1 of the VAT Act 235/2004, the taxpayer can submit an additional VAT report. If the users want to make an additional VAT report, they can select the Report Type - Additional in the report export.  
In the Calculate and Post for VAT Settlement functionality, the Doc. No. is stored in the VAT closing entries as a Tax Return Number for further searching in the VAT statement and reports. This functionality allows calculation and printing for different VAT statements posted and submitted in the same VAT period.
