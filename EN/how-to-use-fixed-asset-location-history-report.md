# Fixed asset location and asset history reports

This feature allows for advanced tracking of changes in the location of fixed assets, including responsible individuals.
By adding this feature, users can control the location history of fixed assets and the history of people responsible for fixed assets.
This feature also provides reports to verify the company where a particular Fixed assets are/were located or to whom he/she is/was assigned.
In order to enable tracking of the location of the FA and the responsible employee (hereafter referred to as FA History), the user must first enable this feature in the FA Settings** window by checking the **Fixed Asset History** checkbox. Once FA History is enabled in FA Settings, the user can start tracking changes to the FA Location and Responsible Employees - these changes are stored in the **FA History table**.

Fixed assets item history:  

- Save changes to FA register
- Include time and user change stamp

New reports have been added to document transactions and history:  

- FA assignment/release
- FA history
