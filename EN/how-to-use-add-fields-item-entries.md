# Origin codes in the item of goods and the item of valuation

The following fields have been added to both records for easier identification of items and appraisal:

- Invoice origin number in which the creditor/payer number is entered
- The origin number of the dispatch to which the recipient's address code is entered
- Currency Code and Currency Factor according to the document from which the item was created.

It is possible to assign a "Cause Code" to each item journal, which is also written into the posted items.
