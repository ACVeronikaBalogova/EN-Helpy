# Multiple receivable/payable accounts  

Users often post transactions as uncollectible receivables or other types of accounts receivable/payable transactions to be recorded in customer/vendor entries but at the same time posted to accounts receivable/payable other than those specified in the customer and vendor posting groups. The simplest way to enable such functionality is to allow the user to change the customer/vendor posting group when posting a sub-transaction.
