# Inventory control - time sequence

Standard Feature [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] was updated with a check of the time continuity of warehouse operations. Once the control is activated, it is ensured that items with a billing date prior to the billing date of receipt cannot be dispensed.
