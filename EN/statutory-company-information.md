# Statutory information about the company

Currently there are many documents circulating outside and inside the company. Local legislation sets minimum requirements for such documents. These requirements can be roughly divided into three groups:

- The names of company representatives must appear on certain internal or external documents.
- Document footers â€“ majority of external documents must contain basic information about the company in the document footers, usually in the language of the partner company.
- Company registration numbers must be prominently listed in internal and external documents.

This feature allows users to define company representatives and set them as CEO, Head Accountant and Finance Manager for use in internal and external documents.
Users can define document footers in different languages. These footers can be used in different reports and documents.

Additional company registration numbers and other registration information may be stored in the Company Information and used in documents.
