# Bank documents for Czech Republic (extension)

This extension adds functionality for bank documents to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../includes/prod_short.md)] for Czech Republic.

The Banking - Documents for Business Central application allows you to define individual **Bank Accounts**, **Create Payment Orders** and **Bank Statements**. An unlimited number of bank accounts can be registered with different banking institutions and in different currencies.

On the basis of posted purchase invoices and advance documents, a *Payment Order** can be generated and printed or exported in a format accepted by the bank's banking interface.

**Received statements** can be imported into the system for a given banking interface, transferred to the Payment journal and the movements on the statement can be posted to the system with the corresponding original entries(e.g. Invoices, Prepayment Document).  
For each bank account, you can predefine your own search rules, based on which the system will match the bank statement lines with the corresponding original entries.

## Main feature

- Set up Bank Accounts
- Set up search rules for automatic payment reconciliation suggestions
- Generate, issue and export a payment order
- Create, import and issue bank statement
- Transfer a bank statement to the Payment Journal
- Automatic draft reconciliation of journal entries + posting of journal entries
