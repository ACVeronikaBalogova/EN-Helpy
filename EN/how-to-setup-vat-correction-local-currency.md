# VAT adjustment in local currency

The current system only allows input VAT to be adjusted in the currency of the document, not in the local currency. According to domestic legislation, domestic documents issued in foreign currency must include the conversion of the VAT amount into CZK and the invoice recipient is obliged to comply with these amounts. Therefore, the possibility to make a VAT adjustment in the local currency or to post this adjustment from an already posted document has been added to the purchase invoice posting process.
