# Discontinuation of depreciation

Depreciation interruption functionality (based on the Income Tax Act Act No.586/1992 ยง26 part 8) allows you to interrupt depreciation for selected fixed assets and the specified period. The system determines the depreciation plan at the end of the interruption period.
The following methods of depreciation of tangible fixed assets for tax purposes are available:  

- Straight-Line

The user can open the FA Depreciation book and fill in **Interupt Depreciation** and **Keep Depr. Ending Date** fields determines whether to preserve the Depreciation Plan.
