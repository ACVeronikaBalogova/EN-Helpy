# Inventory counting documents

At the end of the period, users take a physical inventory to reconcile the actual (physical) value of the inventory with the value registered in the system. As part of this process, the accounting department needs to archive an inventory document containing the posted values with the names of the company representatives who confirm by their signature that the quantities and amounts listed on this document correspond to the quantities physically present at the inventory locations.  

For the above reasons, this function provides the following reports:

- **Physical inventory list** - used to print documents from the physical inventory journal (the existing report has been improved).
- **Physical inventory document** - used to print posted physical inventory.
