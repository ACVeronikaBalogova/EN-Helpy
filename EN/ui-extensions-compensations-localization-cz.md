# Compensations (extension)

The Credits functionality helps companies to credit accounts receivable and payable against each other. Credit Mutuals are used when a company's customer is also its vendor. Entries for crediting can be entered manually or automatically from the Credit Card using the Design Credit Lines function.  Functions are also available to mark entries for crediting and to recalculate the balance. There is also a printout of the Agreement on mutual crediting of receivables and payables according to the Czech legislation.  

## General Functionalities of Credits

- Field **Balance as a vendor/ Balance as a customer** on the customer/vendor card - if you want to display the balance as a vendor on the customer card and the balance as a customer on the vendor card, the user must set up a business relationship between the customer and the vendor with a contact to show the system that the company is registered in the application as a vendor and as a customer, and that they are one and the same company.
- **Credit settings** - No. Series, Credit Balancing Account, etc.,
- **Credit card** - rows to credit,  
- Functions - **Suggest credit lines**, Release,
